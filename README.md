# Dragon’s Abyss

Dragon’s Abyss is a small experimental game I created primarily as a learning project.

The main goal of this project is not to build a polished or commercially viable game, but to learn how games are made: how systems connect, how to structure a project, how to manage scenes, audio, UI and basic gameplay loops.

There was no strict design document or final vision from the start. Features and ideas were added gradually as part of the learning process.

At the moment, the game focuses on functionality rather than balance or polish. The gameplay loop and difficulty are intentionally simple and not fully tuned, as the priority has been understanding how to make systems work correctly before refining them.

The project uses assets from different creators, and visual/audio consistency is not a current goal.

Current features:

- Top-down survival gameplay

- 5 enemy waves

- Player movement and shooting

- Basic enemy AI

- Menus, pause system, audio settings

- Win and game over screens

Future learning goals include:

- More complex enemy behaviors

- Elemental effects and upgrades between waves

- Better project architecture and refactoring

This project will continue evolving as a sandbox for experimentation and learning.
